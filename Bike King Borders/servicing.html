         <h2>Wheel Service £25</h2>
         <p class="text">In our Wheel Service, our mechanics will give your wheels the attention they need. Keeping your wheels serviced is vital to the smooth running of your bicycle and helps to avoid the minor wheel ailments that build up over riding time.

                <p class="text">As the main contact point with the road or trail, the wheels really take the brunt of the terrain. Be it pot holes, roots or just everyday use, it is common for wheels to lose spoke tension, snap spokes or for hubs to stop spinning smoothly. The staff in the store will be able to advise you in detail.
                <br>We would generally recommend you choose a Wheel Service:</p>
        <ul class="servicelists">
            <li class="listtext">If your spokes feel loose, you have some broken spokes or your brakes are rubbing intermittently</li>
            <li class="listtext">If your hubs feel rough or there is play in the wheel itself</li>
            <li class="listtext">After winter to ensure your bike is restored and ready for spring</li>
            <li class="listtext">At least every 12-18 Months</li>
